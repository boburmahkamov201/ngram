# Welcome to My Ngram
***

## Task
Since the program cannot use the strlen function, I made an error using it and deleted it. 

## Description
I created a separate function that executes the strlen function and the problem was solved.

## Installation
I didn't use many libraries, just the stdio.h library

## Usage
This is a program that counts how many times a letter is repeated
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
